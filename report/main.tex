  Angluin's L* algorithm \cite{angluinL} is a famous algorithm for learning deterministic finite state automata from membership and equivalence queries.
  Bollig et al NL* \cite{angluinNL} algorithm is a variant of this algorithm, where the automaton that is learned may be non deterministic, and therefore exponentially more succinct.
  The goal of this TERD is to understand the theory behind these two algorithms, and if the time permits, to implement them and compare them.
