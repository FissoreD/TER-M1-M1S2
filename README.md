# Comparison of L* and NL* algorithm 


ABSTRACT:
Angluin's L* algorithm [[1]](#1) is a famous algorithm for learning deterministic finite state automata from
membership and equivalence queries. 
Bollig et al NL* [[2]](#2) algorithm is a variant of this algorithm, where the automaton that is learned may be
non deterministic, and therefore exponentially more succinct. 
The goal of this TERD is to understand the theory behind these two algorithms, and if the time permits,
to implement them and compare them. 



## About the project
This project has been realized in Spring 2022 with reference to the course "Travail Encadré de Recherche" within the Master 1 in *Computer Science* at the University *Côte d'Azur* in *Biot*.
